# 🧠 LLM Text Intelligence Toolkit

A foundational AI project that demonstrates how modern LLM-powered systems **understand text meaning** using **embeddings and semantic similarity**, without relying on chatbots or heavy generative models.

This project acts as the **core intelligence layer** for advanced systems such as **RAG pipelines, AI agents, and decision-making workflows**.

---

## 🎯 What This Project Does

The toolkit analyzes raw text and extracts semantic insights, including:

- 🧭 **Intent Detection** (Support, Sales, Feedback, General)
- 😊 **Sentiment Analysis** (Positive, Negative, Neutral)
- 🔗 **Semantic Similarity** between two texts
- 🧠 **Meaning-based reasoning** instead of keyword matching

All functionality runs **locally on CPU**, using **free and open-source tools**.

## 🧠 Key AI Concepts Covered

This project focuses on **core LLM fundamentals** that are often skipped:

- Text embeddings
- Semantic similarity
- Cosine distance
- Rule-based vs embedding-based logic
- Deterministic AI systems
- Why embeddings are the backbone of RAG and AI agents

> This is not a chatbot — it is the intelligence engine behind them.
